## **_Milestone Project 4 - Full Stack Frameworks with Django_**

## **Project Description**
The purpose of the project is to build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. Styled is a fictional personal stylist service offering a range of services such as Image Consultation, Personal Shopping, Body Analysis, Full Style Overhaul, Closet Clearout and Corporate Styling Events.  This goal of this project is to provide the user with the ability to purchase and avail of these services or purchase gift vouchers to purchase the services offered. Style is your personal brand and allows you to express yourself and who you are. Fashion is ever changing and it is easy to lose yourself in the sea of constantly shifting style trends. Everyone has their own unique signature style, being comfortable in your own style can boost your confidence if you feel good in what you are wearing. This website provides users the ability to learning how to dress for your body shape, style and personality and leave feeling confident and looking amazing. Additionally this site has also incorporated a Look Book gallery feature where users can find inspiration on outfits for different occasions. In the future I hope to expand on this feature by allowing users to upload their own outfit images and provide an upvote system on these images and links to where the clothing items or similar items can be purchased. I would also like to implement a feature where registered users could save these images to their profile as their favourite looks to view in one place.

## **UX Design**

### **_User Stories_**

### **_Visitors to the site expect:_**
- To navigate the site easily
- Determine the site purpose immediately
- Fast feedback on all actions
- Access order history efficiently
- Secure and reliable payment system
- Browse and locate products with ease

### **_Strategy Plane_**
- The aim of this project was to develop a personal stylist website that provides styling experiences as services such as Image Consultation, Personal Shopping, Full Style Overhaul, Group Style Events and Closet Clearout. The website is professional, modern mimimalist, inviting, and easy to navigate.
- This website was designed with a focus on user experience and user needs, the services offered are expensive as there is alot of time and effort required to execute these services to a high standard so it was important to reflect the exclusivity of these luxury services. However it is also vital to offer the users a user experience that is easy and worth the money they will spend on these services. The aim of the project is to encourage to sign up and purchase the services offered while also ensuring that the user receives prompt feedback, a fast and secure payment system and a efficient means of communication with the service providers. It is designed so only admin users can add/edit/delete products, product features and images and users can add/update and remove items from their shopping bag, adjust quantities and save their default information to their profile for ease of use for the checkout process.
- I have also included a contact form that is allows users both registered and guest to submit an email form to that is sent to the company email address if users have any queries, questions or complaints.

### **_Scope Plane_**
- Thr priority for this project was to create a database of products and services where users could easily browse and purchase products and services and provide smooth CRUD functionality from the front-end of the site for Admin users to add, update and delete items as necessary with ease.
- This project incorporates the use of CRUD functionality for Admin Users to ensure that they can maintain, update and add elements efficiently by providing forms that can only be accessed by an admin user to add/edit/delete products, product features and images for the gallery.
- To ensure these changes are reflected in the navigation bar without any extra hassle I have dynamically set the dropdown menus to populate these items from the database.
- It was extremely important to ensure that the purpose of the site and what it offers was immediately evident to the user from the outset.
- Given the services offered through this site are considered luxury purchases, it was vital to set up a fast and secure payment system for users that would make the checkout experience optimal for users.
- Given my timeframe and skills, my focus was on ensuring that the user experience was smooth and user friendly, that users were provided with sufficient and prompt feedback after all user actions and that any errors were clearly displayed to the user. 
- The idea for this project was also to create a simple but professional looking interface that reflected the company's brand.
The site needed to be easy to navigate, so it was necessary to include a search bar on the navbar. I want to users to have the ability to search for products from anywhere on the website.
- Having the navigation bar menu displayed at all times, allows the user to navigate to any page at any time while exploring the site such as profile, login and logout buttons, services, about, contact and gallery pages.
- The use of vivid images, and minimal text on the product pages, was done so that the user isn't overwhelmed with information, but has the option to get more information about a specific product if they want.
- The product info page is where the user can get further more detailed information on each product which displays the product description, price, and product features of what will be included in this service if purchased.
- All pages contain buttons or links that will direct the user back, such as on the product info page there is a link to direct the user back to the products category page. The bag page has a button to take the user back to browse further products before purchasing. The checkout page has a button to redirect the user back if they need to adjust items within their bag before completing the order. All confirmation pages such as the thank you page from the contact form submission or the order confirmation page provide a button to redirect the user to the Look Book page to explore outfit inspiration.
- It was also essential that registered users have the ability to review any of their past orders and this is achieved by providing the user's order history on their profile page. It also includes a link in the form of the order number which will direct them to the order confirmation for that specific order.
- I wanted the site to be accessible to all, but with extra features/benefits for registered users. The products and services can be seen and accessed by everyone who visits the site, and any user can contact the site owners via the contact page form but only registered users can save their default delivery address and view their order history.
- A future goal for this project would be to allow users to upload their own 'outfit inspiration' pics to the the Look Book Page and possibly use an upvote/like system on these images with the aim of allowing users to save favourite looks to their profile page. Due to time constraints this was not achieveable for this project.
- Another future goal for this project will be to offer the services provided in an online capacity through the use of video conferencing and this would be reflected in an online price and an in-person price. The online price has been included in the product model, however again due to time constraints I have not been able to implement this aspect at this stage.

### **_Structure Plane_**
- The structure of this website was designed to be easy to navigate and user-friendly. The navigation bar is visible on every page, and includes different links depending on whether a user is logged in, a guest user or the admin user. 
- The project consists of 7 apps: Home, About, Products, Gallery, Profiles, Bag & Checkout.
- The colour scheme is minimal with a pop of orange color and plenty vibrant images to grab the attention of the user and provide an inviting and professional experience.

#### **_Home App_**
- The homepage is simple and straightforward, with a an image carousel, and a jumbotron with minimal text that states the website's purpose and a call to action button 'Let's Get Styled' which acts as a link to the products page to encourage the user to check out the services the site offers.
- A search bar is located at the top of the page allowing the user to search the services available on the site. The navigation bar includes a dropdown menu of a list of the services provided and will take the user to the service detail pages for each one with a link for all services included on this list., The user can also avail of a dropdown menu 'Look Book' which provides a list of outfit collections to browse outfits within these collections. This will take the user directly to the 'Look Book' page. The navbar is simple yet professional using black text and dropdown items highlighted in orange.
- A shopping bag icon is also located at the top of the page, to indicate to the user the total amount for any items they have added to their bag. This is visible on all pages throughout the site.
- The homepage also contains a brief description about the company and what we do. Giving the user a basic introduction to the company values and goals.
- The bottom of the homepage features another carousel displaying a few customer testimonials with rouned image and blockquotes. This allows the user to gain insight into some of the experiences of other users.
- The footer is minimal, displaying copyright information to the left and two social icon links to the company's Instagram and Facebook pages.
- The contact page is located within the Home App. The layout is a contact form with fields for Email(customer's email), subject and message. The user can complete this form and submit it to send an email directly to the site owners. On submitting the form the email will be sent directly to the site owner email and the user will be directed to a Thank You page.
- The Thank You page is designed to alert the user that the email was sent successfully and that they will receive a response as soon as possible. A button is also located on this page, 'Check Out our Looks', when clicked will direct the user to check out the Look Book page displaying all the outfits for inspiration.

#### **_About App_**
- The about page is structured into 3 sections: some information on the company, with an image to the left and text, a 'what we do' section with icons displaying the services we offer and a link to each service using a call to action button 'More Info' and at the bottom of the page, a section on the team 'Style Squad' which is a card layout with top image and text underneath with employee title, name and email.

#### **_Products App_**
- The products page is displayed using a card layout with top image and service name and price underneath each image. The image acts as a link to the product detail page for each service. The design will display the cards with 3 images to each row on larger screens, 2 images per row on medium screens and one image to each row on small screens. This page also shows the user the number of results found if they have used the search bar to locate products and the accompanying label acts as a link to all products.
- The giftcard page has the same layout as the products using a card structure, with product images and a card with basic product information. This page is designed to only display products from the gift voucher category. Gift Vouchers range from 100 euro to 500 euro currently. The idea behind the gift vouchers as products is that they would be a pre-paid credit card that would be posted to the user and the mechanism would allow the user to purchase items with these in the same way as a credit card.
- The product detail page is designed using a card layout with image to the left and text on the right on medium screens and up and displayed with top image and text below on small screens. The product detail page includes product image, product name, description, price and a quantity input field. The quantity input field allows the user to increase or decrease the quanity of the items they wish to purchase. It also includes 2 call to action buttons, 'Add to Bag' and 'Keep Shopping'. The 'Add to Bag' button, when clicked will add the item to the customer's bag and this will be reflecte with a success message to the user through the use of Bootstrap toasts. This message will alert the user the product has been added o their bag and will populate the bag total on the navbar to reflect this action. The 'Keep Shopping' button, when clicked will direct the user back to the all products page where they can continue browsing for items. 
- The bottom half of the product detail page, shows the user a list of product features, these describe what is included in the specified service. These product features are not a required for all products, i.e Gift Voucher products do not have any product features displayed on the product detail pages.
- As an Admin user or site owner, I have designed CRUD functionality to allow these users the ability to add, edit and delete products and product features. If an Admin user is logged in on the product detail page, 2 links, 'Edit' and 'Delete' are provided underneath the product image and undernath each product feature. The 'Edit' link will direct the user to the Edit Product or Edit Product Feature template. This template contains a form which is auto populated with the specified product/product feature information and will allow the user to edit these fields. There are 2 form buttons located at the bottom, 'Edit Product' and 'Cancel'. 
- If an Admin User is logged in, they can also access the 'Product Management' link on the navbar. This link will direct the user to the 'Add Product' page, where they can add a new product to the database. It contains 2 form buttons at the bottom of the form: 'Add Product' and 'Cancel'.

#### **_Gallery App_**
- The 'Look Book' page consists of outfit images from 4 different collections. It uses card layout with 3 images displayed per row on larger screens, 2 images per row on medium screens and 1 image per row on small screens. On the 'All Looks' page, there are badges located at the top which show the user all the collections available to view. These badges, when clicked will direct the user to the specified collection. It will also alert the user as to the number of images within this selection and provide a link next to this number to bring the user back to 'All Looks'.
- As an Admin user or site owner, I have designed CRUD functionality to allow these users the ability to add, edit and delete images within the gallery. If an Admin user is logged in on the Look Book page, 2 links, 'Edit' and 'Delete' are provided underneath the gallery image. The 'Edit' link will direct the user to the Edit Image page. This page contains a form which is auto populated with the specified image information and will allow the user to edit these fields. There are 2 form buttons located at the bottom, 'Edit Image' and 'Cancel'. 
- If an Admin User is logged in, they can also access the 'Look Book Management' link on the navbar. This link will direct the user to the 'Add Image' page, where they can add a new image to the look book page and to the database. It contains 2 form buttons at the bottom of the form: 'Add Image' and 'Cancel'.

#### **_Profiles App_**
- The profiles app contains the user profile page. Once a user registers for an account and verifies their email address, the user can then login to the site and gain access to their own profile page.
This page layout is designed with a form layout for the user's default delivery information and a table layout to display the user's order history. If the user makes a purchase, they will have the choice to selct a checkbox to save their information to their profile. If this box is clicked and a purchase is made, then when the user navigates to their profile page from the navbar menu they will be able to see this information reflected in the profile page. The default deleivery information will be populate with the address they provided on the checkout form. The order history information will display the users orders including order number, order date, items in the order and the order total. The order number acts as a link, that when clicked, will direct the user to the order confirmation page for that specific order.

#### **_Bag App_**
- The bag page is located in the bag app and is where users can view the items they have added to their bag. The items are displayed include the product image, product quantity, product price and a subtotal of these items. A quantity input element allows the user to increase or decrease the quantity of the specific items in their bag. Directly underneath the quantity element are 2 links, 'Update' and 'Remove'. The 'Update' link, once clicked will update the quantity of the item in the shopping bag. The 'Remove' link, when clicked will remove the item from the user's shopping bag.
- Two call to action buttons are located at the end of the shopping bag page, ' Secure Checkout' and 'Keep Shopping'. If the user clicks the 'Secure Checkout' button they will be directed to the checkout page to complete their order and purchase the items in the shopping bag. The 'Keep Shopping' button, when clicked, will direct the user back to the all products page to keep browsing for products.
- The shopping bag page was refactored to display a different layout on mobile screens for ease of use for the user when purchasing items on a mobile device.

#### **_Checkout App_**
- Once the user has clicked the 'Secure Checkout' button on either the shopping bag page or from the shopping bag alert on the navbar, they will be directed to the checkout page. This page displays the checkout form on the left and the order items on the right on medium screens and up and displays the order items on top and the checkout form underneath on smaller screens. The checkout form consists of fields name, email, delivery address and card number. 
- There are two buttons located at the bottom of the form, 'Complete Order' and 'Ajust Bag'. The Complete Order button will submit the order form and will direct the user to any form errors if these exist before submitting and completing the stripe authentication on the user's card. The Adjust Bag button will direct the user back to the shopping bag page where they can edit the items within the shopping bag before making their purchase. 
- Once the user clicks complete order, a spinner icon will appear to show the user that the transaction is being processed and disable the checkout buttons, to avois any duplicate charges to the user's card. 
- If the payment is successful the user will be directed to the checkout success page. This page displays the order confirmation including order number, order date, user details, order total and order items. The user will also receive an alert via bootstrap toasts, which will tell the user that the order was successful and an email confirmation for this order will be sent to the email address provided on the form.
- This checkout success page also features a call to action button at the bottom 'Check out our Looks', which will direct the user to the Look Book page on order completion.
- If the user is a registered user and has saved their default information to their profile, when the user navigates to the checkout page, their details will be auto populated on the checkout form.

### **Database Architecture**

The database for this project was created using PostgreSQL in production and SQLite3 in development. 
It consists of 8 models:

- Categories: stores the category name and category friendly name
- Products: stores the product name, category which is a foreign key to the category model, description, online price, price, image url and image.
- Product Features: stores the product feature name and associated products which is a many to many field

### **_Surface Plane_**
#### **_Colours_**
- For this project, I decided to use a minimalist approach to the colour scheme as I wanted it to reflect the professional brand of the company. The colours chosen are white, black and orange. 
- The site uses alot of vivid imagery so for this reason I have kept the main background white, so as not to overshadow the images. The testimonial carousel has a bright orange background just to add a pop of colour without overwhelming the user.
- The text is mainly black with some orange text used to highlight some elements of text in areas such as the shopping bag, checkout page and form element labels.

#### **_Typography_**
- The fonts chosen for this project were 'Brygada 1918' for the logo and headers, as it has a nice design, a creative feel while also looking professional and clear, and is visually attractive. The body of the website uses the font 'Roboto Slab' as it reads well, and doesn't distract from the actual content of the site, while still looking professional.

#### **_Images_**
The images for this site were sourced from a variety of locations:

The carousel images on the homepage were sourced from Pexels.com & [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/)
The services images and gift voucher images were sourced from [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/)
The Look Book images were sourced from [Pinterest.com](https://www.pinterest.com/)
The logo image on the profile page and product details features section was created using [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/logo-maker/app/).
The logo images on the about page for the services were created for this project using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).
